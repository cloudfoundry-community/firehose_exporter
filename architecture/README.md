# Architecture diagram

The architecture image was drawn on [https://www.draw.io/][draw]. The native source file is called `architecture.xml`,
while `architecture.svg` is its SVG export.

To change the architecture diagram, go to [https://www.draw.io/][draw] and import the XML source file. After making
changes to the diagram, export the result as SVG. Update both the source file and the SVG export in this directory.
